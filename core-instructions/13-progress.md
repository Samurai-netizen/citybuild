# Progress and Resume Point (living file)

> The AI updates this file at **every checkpoint**, not only at the end of a task (`16` §D).
> Keep it ≤ 80 lines: overwrite old details. History lives in the build log and git.

## Resume point
- **State:** IN PROGRESS   <!-- IDLE | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | AWAITING OWNER -->
- **Task:** M0-07a · Content model with research and eras: the engine (`[O]` `[PLAN]`, plan approved). M0-07b follows in its own PR
- **Branch:** `task/M0-07a-content-model` (from `main` = `23f7464`)
- **Build log entry:** `docs/build-log/2026/2026-10-14-05-M0-07a.md` (Session 1; decisions 1–8 hold the approved design of both parts)
- **Last green commit:** the head of this branch (step 2: 0 warnings, format clean, fast suite 234 passed)
- **Done steps:** 1 (write-ahead, plan approved, split into M0-07a/M0-07b), 2 (typed ids). Planned steps: build log entry → Session 1 → Plan
- **Next step:** step 3: `*Data` input classes, definitions, `GameContent`, `ContentError`, and the factory's shape phase (tests first).
- **Open questions for the owner:** guard test in CI (KIT-AUDIT-FIXES follow-up); [MANUAL] run `test-unity.ps1` once on Windows (never
  executed); the template sample content (M0-04 follow-up).
- **Known broken / do not touch:** —
- **Verify with:** `bash scripts/dev/check-docs.sh` · `dotnet build server/CityBuilder.slnx` · `dotnet test server/CityBuilder.slnx --filter "Category!=Integration"` ·
  `UNITY_EDITOR=<Unity program> bash scripts/dev/test-unity.sh` (Editor closed)

## Milestone
**M0 — vertical slice of Era I** · board: `docs/plan/M0-PLAN.md` · tasks done: 6 / 85

| Area | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo, kit, hooks, CI | done | M0-01 and the audit fixes merged (PR #4, #5); A18 can be closed in M0-04 |
| Shared engine: content, research, labor | in progress | M0-03 (package, build project, helpers, architecture tests) merged (PR #7); the content model is M0-07a (engine) and M0-07b (JSON, server loading) |
| Shared engine: invariants, performance | not started | |
| Server skeleton | done | M0-02 merged (PR #6) |
| Persistence (EF + PostgreSQL) | not started | |
| Auth + command pipeline | not started | |
| Commands: place / upgrade / assign workers / start research | not started | |
| Unity skeleton + networking | in progress | M0-04 (project, assemblies, GameRoot) and M0-05 (Unity tests, `test-unity.sh`) merged (PR #8, #12); networking is M0-37 |
| Unity city view + placement | not started | |
| Inspector, worker stepper, research screen, HUD | not started | |
| Resilience (limits, retries, logging) | not started | |
| Docs automation (DocTools) + docs completeness | not started | |
| Balance simulator | not started | |
| E2E / security / concurrency suites | not started | |
| Dev build + M0 close-out | not started | |

States: `not started` · `in progress` · `done` · `blocked (reason)`

## Commands that work right now
All run in M0-06 (details and the "since" task: `docs/getting-started.md` → Run).
- **Process:** `bash scripts/dev/setup-hooks.sh` · `bash scripts/dev/check-docs.sh [--base origin/main]` · `bash scripts/dev/show-task.sh <ID>` ·
  `bash scripts/dev/new-log-entry.sh <ID> "<title>" "<tool / model>"` · `bash scripts/dev/test-guard-bash.sh` (after changing the Bash guard)
- **Server:** `dotnet restore server/CityBuilder.slnx --locked-mode` · `dotnet format server/CityBuilder.slnx --verify-no-changes` ·
  `dotnet build server/CityBuilder.slnx` · `dotnet test server/CityBuilder.slnx --filter "Category!=Integration"` ·
  `dotnet run --project server/src/CityBuilder.Api`, then `curl http://localhost:8080/health` → `Healthy`
- **Unity (Editor closed):** `UNITY_EDITOR=<Unity program> bash scripts/dev/test-unity.sh` (`.ps1` on Windows, never run yet) · compile check
  `<UNITY> -batchmode -quit -projectPath client/CityBuilder -logFile -` (exit 0, no `error CS`; `client/README.md`)
- **Not yet:** integration tests (the filter finds none until M0-21) · `docker compose` (M0-19) · DocTools (M0-61) · `quality.sh` (M0-62) ·
  BalanceSim (M0-67)

## Open issues / tech debt
- Audit item A18 (Unity 6.6 installed, the stack pins 6.3) is closed: the project is 6000.3.25f1 (M0-04).
- Unity manifest pins below the editor's minimum or overridden in the lock (URP, test framework, navigation, timeline, ...): M0-66 audit.
- Other kit wording items with their owner tasks: M0-01 build log → Follow-ups.

## Deviations from the plan
- M0-07 is split into M0-07a (engine) and M0-07b (JSON file, server loading), one PR each: the owner's choice in the plan approval
  (build log BL-20261014-05, decision 1). Split plan tasks carry a letter; the commit id pattern allows it (`18`).
