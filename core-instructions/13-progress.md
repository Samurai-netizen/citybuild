# Progress and Resume Point (living file)

## Resume point
- **State:** IN PROGRESS   <!-- IDLE | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | AWAITING OWNER -->
- **Task:** CR-0002-T1 · Handbook site and docs-as-code workflow (`docs/changes/CR-0002-docs-site.md`, owner's request of 2026-10-20)
- **Branch:** `task/CR-0002-T1-docs-site` (from `main` = `e10937a`)
- **Build log entry:** `docs/build-log/2026/2026-10-20-01-CR-0002-T1.md`
- **Last green commit:** the head of the branch (site builds; no .NET change; fast suite at `e10937a`: Simulation 872, Domain 1,
  Application 14, IntegrationTests 25)
- **Steps:** 1 start ✓ · 2 site in `website/` ✓ · 3 CI and `check-docs.sh` checks ✓ · 4 workflow docs ✓ · 5 audit of all docs against the
  code ✓ · 6 finish (details: the entry's Session 1 plan)
- **Next step:** step 6: finish (`16` §E): CHANGELOG line, close the Docs impact table, `check-docs.sh --base origin/main`, site build,
  fast suite, self-review, PR.
- **Open questions for the owner:** guard test in CI (KIT-AUDIT-FIXES follow-up); [MANUAL] run `test-unity.ps1` once on Windows (never
  executed); the template sample content (M0-04 follow-up).
- **Known broken / do not touch:** —
- **Verify with:** `bash scripts/dev/check-docs.sh` · `dotnet build server/CityBuilder.slnx` · `dotnet test server/CityBuilder.slnx --filter "Category!=Integration"` ·
  `UNITY_EDITOR=<Unity program> bash scripts/dev/test-unity.sh` (Editor closed)

States: `not started` · `in progress` · `done` · `blocked (reason)`

## Commands that work right now
All run in M0-06, the handbook in CR-0002-T1 (details and the "since" task: `docs/getting-started.md` → Run).
- **Process:** `bash scripts/dev/setup-hooks.sh` · `bash scripts/dev/check-docs.sh [--base origin/main]` · `bash scripts/dev/show-task.sh <ID>` ·
  `bash scripts/dev/new-log-entry.sh <ID> "<title>" "<tool / model>"` · `bash scripts/dev/test-guard-bash.sh` (after changing the Bash guard) ·
  `bash scripts/dev/docs-site.sh build` (the handbook; `start` previews it; Node.js 20+)
- **Server:** `dotnet restore server/CityBuilder.slnx --locked-mode` · `dotnet format server/CityBuilder.slnx --verify-no-changes` ·
  `dotnet build server/CityBuilder.slnx` · `dotnet test server/CityBuilder.slnx --filter "Category!=Integration"` ·
  `dotnet run --project server/src/CityBuilder.Api` (loads `server/content/mvp-content.json`; another file: `-- --Content:FilePath=<file>`),
  then `curl http://localhost:8080/health` → `Healthy`
- **Unity (Editor closed):** `UNITY_EDITOR=<Unity program> bash scripts/dev/test-unity.sh` (`.ps1` on Windows, never run yet) · compile check
  `<UNITY> -batchmode -quit -projectPath client/CityBuilder -logFile -` (exit 0, no `error CS`; `client/README.md`)
- **Not yet:** integration tests (the filter finds none until M0-21) · `docker compose` (M0-19) · DocTools (M0-61) · `quality.sh` (M0-62) ·
  BalanceSim (M0-67)

## Open issues / tech debt
- Audit item A18 (Unity 6.6 installed, the stack pins 6.3) is closed: the project is 6000.3.25f1 (M0-04).
- Unity manifest pins below the editor's minimum or overridden in the lock (URP, test framework, navigation, timeline, ...): M0-66 audit.
- Other kit wording items with their owner tasks: M0-01 build log → Follow-ups.

## Deviations from the plan
- M0-07 is split into M0-07a (engine) and M0-07b (JSON file, server loading), one PR each: the owner's choice in the plan approval
  (build log BL-20261014-05, decision 1). Split plan tasks carry a letter; the commit id pattern allows it (`18`).
